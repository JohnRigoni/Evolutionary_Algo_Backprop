# evolutionary_algorithm
Differential Evolution and Swarm Particle Optimization on Neural Network for Classification and Regression. Implimented for Machine Learning 447 at Montana State University.

There are 2 folders. Algorithms contains Differential Evolution and Swarm Particle Optimization. Neural Network contains the code for a neural network, including backpropogation which was not used in this project. I also incuded the file used to turn the dataset into 10 folds worth of train set and test set.
