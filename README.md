# Nueral Network with Backpropagation and Evolutionary Algorithms
No help Nueral Network with Backpropogation and Momentum, and Differential Evolution and Swarm Particle Optimization built on top for Classification and Regression. Implemented for Machine Learning 447 at Montana State University.

There are two folders. Algorithms contains the code for Differential Evolution and Swarm Particle Optimization. Neural Network is self-evident. Both are designed for classification and regression tasks.
